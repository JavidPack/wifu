This is a list of packet requirements that I can think of:

1. Must have a to_bytes() method (to use when calling send())
2. Must have a size() method
3. Must have an (ordered) list of HeaderObjects
4. SequenceNumber should be a subclass of HeaderObject and be its own class overriding all the signs so we can keep track of circular numbers
5. Same thing (as #4) for acknowledgement numbers.  Maybe we have a middle class which supports modulo comparisions.
