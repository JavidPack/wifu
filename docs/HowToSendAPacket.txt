How to send a packet.  We need to get a response from each state machine (or current state) whether or not it is okay to send a packet (of N bytes).



Before the socket can pass a packet to the UDPInterface, we must get approval from all FSMs.
This document contains Randy's ideas on how we might want to do this:

A) Trylock type thing
B) Pass in a sem that the caller waits on, then the state posts on it when it is determined that it is allowed to send the packet.
C) Queue at each state that state reads from, sleeps otherwise
D) Socket has counting semaphore which each state machine can post on indicating number of [bytes|packets] it can handle.  Socket takes the [min] of all these values.  Socket waits on that sem.  As a subpoint, we would likely need to redefine what a counting semaphore is so it can support waiting/posting on more than one [byte] at a time.  As a variant of this, we could loop through each FSMs send semaphore and wait on each one.
E) Machine (state) blocks itself until it can send.
