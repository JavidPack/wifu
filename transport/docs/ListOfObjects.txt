Pieces of the TCP Puzzle (building blocks):

This is a list of things that we will need to build TCP as defined in RFC 793.  These are likely not decomposed far enough in general; however, some objects might be decomposed too far (less likely).  I will add to this list as we deem necessary.  Mark "completed" objects with an '*' like this:

* FileReader

This way we can easily scan the list to see what needs to be done.  I do expect us to forget about this document and not read it all the time, so when we do, we should update it appropriately.

TCPState
Listen
SynSent
SynReceived
Established
FinWait1
FinWait2
CloseWait
Closing
LastAck
TimeWait
Closed

Timer
SendBuffer -- Queue?
ReceiveBuffer -- Queue?
SendWindow
Packet
Header
UDPInterface
Checksum
TCP (Transmission Control Block) -- likely will be the 'context' in the state machine
Multiplexer
Deplexer
Controller (as defined in the grant proposal)
