This is a list of things that need to happen on startup of the daemon process.
No order is present (yet).

1. call fork() and detach
2. Do we need to create any objects?  will the main ones be singletons?
3. load appropriate plugins which implement a protocol
4. Register modules to send events to appropriate places.  Config file to do this?
