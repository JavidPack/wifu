# Format is as follows
# seq ack delay
# seq: the sequence number of the packet
# ack: the ack number of the packet
# note: a delay is in microseconds
# note: a delay of -1 means it will drop the packet

# if seq and ack are both -1, then we will randomly drop all packet by the percentage noted in the third column
# for example, -1 -1 50 would drop packets 50% of the time

2 3 -1
